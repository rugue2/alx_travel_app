# About the Project

**alxtravelapp** is a real-world Django application designed as the foundation for a travel listing platform. This milestone focuses on establishing the initial project structure, configuring a robust database, and integrating essential tools for API documentation and maintainable configurations. The goal is to introduce industry-standard best practices for efficiently starting and managing Django-based projects.

Key learning outcomes include setting up a scalable backend, integrating MySQL for database management, and using Swagger for automated API documentation. These foundational steps are crucial for preparing the application for future features and enabling seamless team collaboration.
